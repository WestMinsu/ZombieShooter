## Zombie Shooter Prototype

### 🔫 Zombie Shooter Prototype 🎮

This is a zombie shooter game prototype developed using **Unreal Engine 5.4**.

### 📖 Purpose of the Prototype
The primary purpose of this prototype was to explore and implement the features of the Unreal Engine 5 **First Person Template**.

The key features implemented in this project are:

* **First-Person Character Controller**: A character controller that allows the player to move around in a 3D space, jump, and shoot.
* **Weapon System**: A system that allows the player to fire a weapon continuously while holding down the mouse button and reload the weapon by pressing the 'R' key.
* **Zombie AI**: A basic AI system for zombies that allows them to chase and attack the player.

### ⌨️ Controls
The player can be controlled using the following keys:

* **Move**: WASD
* **Jump**: Spacebar
* **Shoot**: Mouse Click (Hold for continuous fire)
* **Reload**: R

### 💡 Potential Enhancements
While this prototype successfully implements the core mechanics, here are several features that could be added to expand it into a more complete game:

* **Different Zombie Types**: Introducing different types of zombies with unique behaviors and abilities, such as a fast runner or a tanky brute.
* **Advanced Weapon System**: Implementing various types of weapons with different stats, such as damage, fire rate, and reload speed.
* **Score and Wave System**: A system that tracks the player's score and spawns more zombies as the player survives for longer periods.
* **Power-ups**: Introducing power-ups that temporarily boost the player's abilities, such as a temporary damage increase or a health pack.
